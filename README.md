# Intraday Trading Strategy using RNN and TensorFlow

## Description
This project involves developing and implementing an intraday trading strategy using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with TensorFlow. The strategy is tested using historical intraday data.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for intraday trading data.
- Implementation of RNN for time series prediction.
- Backtesting framework to evaluate the strategy's performance.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
